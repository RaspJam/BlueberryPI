# Dependencies
`pi-gen`

# Building
> [!WARNING]
> BlueberryPI is designed to be built on a Debain-based system in accordance to [pi-gen](https://github.com/rpi-distro/pi-gen); the tool making this OS possible.
>
> If you do not have access to a Debain/Ubuntu system I would recommend using [Vagrant](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant) and running the respective build script `some/path/run_vagrant_build.sh`.
Alternativly you could build BlueberryPI inside of a VM using tools like VirtualBox, VMWare, QEMU, etc...
